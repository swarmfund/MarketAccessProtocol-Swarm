# Market Access Protocol

Market Access Protocol (MAP) solves existing inefficiencies and difficulties encountered by token issuers, investors, exchanges, and qualification providers. 

Until now, there has been no ‘one’ globally compliant protocol to provide a framework on which the industry can build to integrate and transfer security tokens in a uniform way. This is because each centralized, for-profit entity is incentivized to do what is best for themselves, not to think about interoperability or broader access beyond their scope. To that end, MAP is an open source infrastructure, designed to be the industry standard protocol empowering the entire security token market.

Market Access Protocol allows:

- Qualification Providers
- Token Issuers
- Investors
- Wallets
- Exchanges

to easily add a compliance layer to any cryptocurrency based digital asset.

For using the SDK and MAP API please consult the [API documentation](https://marketaccessprotocol.docs.apiary.io).
