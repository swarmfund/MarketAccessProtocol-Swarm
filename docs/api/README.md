## RESTful
The MAP API is RESTful, meaning that all API calls are stateless and can be used without maintaining local duplicated state in the implementing application.

The API is designed according to a set of ground rules which simplify the implementation process:

- All API requests are sent with form encoded body to make file attachments easier to send
- All API responses are sent in JSON format
- All API responses include a descriptive message which is ready to be shown to the user and a corresponding limited set of HTTP status codes:
  - `HTTP 200` / OK
  - `HTTP 400` / malformed request format or body
  - `HTTP 401` / missing or bad Authorization header
  - `HTTP 403` / request is authenticated but not authorized for access to this particular resource
  - `HTTP 422` / request cannot be fulfilled because of unmet user requirements
  - `HTTP 503` / request cannot be fulfilled at the given moment, please try again later
  
## Authentication and authorization
Authentication and authorization is handled via Authorization header which brings ease of implementation which does not require setting different CORS headers to allow different origins from accessing the API.	

Aside from this, using the JWT (Json Web Tokens) implementation scheme allows for bundling encrypted metadata with each request allowing managing arbitrary user data throughout the session and expiration of tokens.


## SDK
We aim to support most languages for frontend and backend developers. We will provide examples in: curl, Python, PHP, Java, NodeJS, and more. Front-end DApps, such as wallets, will be able to use via C++, JavaScript and other relevant languages via client-side SDK.
